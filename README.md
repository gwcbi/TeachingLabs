# Computational Biology Institute Teaching Resources

This Github repository is meant to be paired with the BISC2584/PUBH3199 (3201) course at the George Washington University.
There are two types of assignments: labs and problem sets. 

## Labs
Labs are designed to provide in-depth experience in developing novel software, using existing software, and manipulating data. Labs are meant to be written up in the style of a scientific manuscript, complete with references in the style of the academic journal "Bioinformatics". Students are allowed and encouraged to work collaboratively on the labs, however, the writing in each lab report must be the original work of the individual student.

## Problem Sets
Problem sets are key to exploring the concepts introduced both in class and in the textbook. These are meant to provide an opportunity to more deeply understand concepts and put them into practice and provide an opportunity for data manipulation. Students are permitted to work collaboratively, in groups, on the problem sets.

## In-Class Exercises
In addition, we also host some in-class exercise files here.
