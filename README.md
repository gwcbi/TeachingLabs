# Computational Biology Institute Teaching Resources

This Github repository is meant to be paired with the BISC2584/PUBH3199 (3201) course at the George Washington University.
There are two types of assignments: labs (slightly more involved) and problem sets. 

## Labs
Labs are designed to provide in-depth experience in developing novel software, using existing software, and manipulating data. Labs are meant to be written up in the style of a scientific manuscript, complete with references in the style of the academic journal "Bioinformatics". Students are allowed and encouraged to work collaboratively on the labs, however, the writing in each lab report must be the original work of the individual student.

## Problem Sets
Problem sets are key to exploring the concepts introduced both in class and in the textbook. These are meant to provide an opportunity to more deeply understand concepts and put them into practice and provide an opportunity for data manipulation. Students are permitted to work collaboratively, in groups, on the problem sets.

## In-Class Exercises
In addition, we also host some in-class exercise files here.

## Research Project (Final)

Students will choose a unique project to work on. At the end of the semester, students will give
a class presentation on their project and submit a written project report as well in the form of a
scientific poster. Students are strongly encouraged to work in groups of up to three on their
projects, however such groups will be expected to give a proportionally longer presentation in
which each member contributes fairly. Many forms of projects will be acceptable, as long as
they are interesting, informative, and related to the course topics.
