# Research Project Assignment #1


## Instructions
Your final research project presentation should consist of a Poster Presentation. 
Templates of posters are available on BlackBoard, and there are many examples throughout the SEH building.

## Guidelines
Your Research Project should be organized as a scientific paper. Your poster presentation should be like the lab reports that you've been writing all semester in a graphical format. It should include all of the following **key elements**:

1. Title
2. Authors
3. Introduction
4. Materials & Methods
5. Results
6. Discussion/Conclusion
7. References (much fewer references are expected in a poster than in a paper)


Here are some tips from NIH on good poster presentations:

## Poster Submission
You must submit your final poster as a PDF file to Blackboard.  Everyone within a group can submit the exact same poster, but each individual must submit a version of the poster to receive credit.
