# Research Project Assignment #2


## Task
Organize a research group and topic.  Develop a title for your research project and a one paragraph ‘abstract’ of how you see the project moving forward.  Then develop a detailed outline (following the framework discussed in class) that provides some background on the study, a description of the data and methods used, and anticipated results.  Feel free to use bullet points in the outline, but also use some references, especially for the data and methods. Submit a project title, names of the research team, your one paragraph summary (abstract), and outline by the due date.  

## Guidelines
Use the following format:

**Title:** An exciting title that coveys the concept of your project.

**Authors:** A list of the students working together to complete the project.

**Abstract:** A one paragraph description of the research project, the central theme, the dataset(s) to be used, questions to be addressed, and methods.  

**Outline:** Develop an outline of your project with an Introduction, Methods, and Results. Be sure to detail your data and methods and provide some appropriate references.  

Please consult the journal *Bioinformatics* for example abstracts and research paper outlines for both data analysis and software research projects.
